OOP is a programming paradigm, or pattern, centered around objects.In OOp, we solve problems by employing collections of objects that work together.Tehir ability to communicate with each other makes the objects particularly well - suited to address large, complex problems.OOP offers the following benefits:
Encapsulation: Object data(and functions) can be neatly stored(ie Encapsulation);
Inheritance: New classes can be created based on the other classes(ie the person class is parent to the student and teacher classes);
Abstraction: Creating a simple model of something complex;
Polymorphism: Multiple object types can implement the same functionality.
