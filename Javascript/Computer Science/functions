Higher order functions:
are any function that takes in or returns a function (or
takes in a callback)-- ie. promises, map, all array methods, express routes,
event listeners, etc. they are what allow us to compose functions to do many
things in a specific order or do many things (map). *Abstraction*


Closures:
A function that encapsulates some scope (constants inside of the function). Typically returns a way of interacting
with the scope in the form of another function. 


Factory functions: 
Leverage closures rather than ORM. 
function creates an object inside of the function that can not be accessed from
outside of the closure other than thru the methods that are returned. Theres is
no inheritance of the methods.(access scope inside closure only).
