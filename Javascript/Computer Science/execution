Computer Science- study of computational systems- how computers and programs
work 

BigO notation describes the complexity of the algorithms that heps us describe
how the algorithm works. O(growth-factor)

Data structure- how data is stored


Global vs. Functional

Global- once function has resolved, it gets 'cleaned up' - js system goes back
thru and removes from memory anything that has finished executing and is no
longer needed.

strict mode- function in global 'this' must be explicitly defined. 
use strict is implicit in ES6- helps keep scope clean.
