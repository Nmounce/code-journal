Object-Relational Mapping

Code is organized using objects instead of functions
Can inherit properties from other objects 
Multiple objects can be created from the same blueprint classes or constructor
functions. 
Allows us to set up obj methods to run generic SQL queries, structure objects to
mimic how the data is stated in the database 


//create
//read
//update = put
//delete



Start with models (draw out), Then build out routes- get 1 subject done at a
time (traveller, then location, then trips)
