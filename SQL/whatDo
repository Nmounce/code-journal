schema creates database and structures it sets up files, input all table info on schema files
seeds file populates the database with a placeholder or seed
    run seed with: source seeds.sql (pulls seeds.sql file)

start sql in terminal: mysql -u root -p 

DESCRIBE tablename: shows schema for table in terminal 

select all items from a table: SELECT * FROM tablename  


you can use AUTO INCRIMENT to add a number value to listed items (id's,
position, etc.)[ex. id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT];

check the schema of an existing table: DESCRIBE tablename  

show specific rows from a table: SELECT fieldname, fieldname2 FROM tablename

add a parameter to allow for narrowing results: SELECT fieldname, fieldname2 FROM tablename WHERE MONTH(birth_date) = 9; //only shows people whos bday is september

limit number of records that show: SELECT fieldname, fieldname2 FROM tablename WHERE MONTH(birth_date) = 9 LIMIT 25 //only shows first 25 records

navigate out of shell: exit;

variables are marked with a "?", followed by the variable parameter:
    ex. app.get('/students/:id', (req, res) => {
        db.query('SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = ?', req.params.id,
        function (err, results) {
            res.json(results);
        });
    })
    //multiple params can be put into an array [a, b]


functions that help analyze data: aggregate functions (get specific info out of a database)
ex. SELECT department, COUNT(id) AS num_courses FROM course_names GROUP BY department;

join: SELECT * FROM columnname1 JOIN columnname2 ON columnname1.columnname2 = columnname2.id;
